# iVolve Technologies - Lab11 - Ansible Dynamic Inventories

## **Objective**

### Set up Ansible dynamic inventories to automatically discover and manage infrastructure. Use Ansible Galaxy role to install Apache.

**What is a Dynamic Inventory?**
Dynamic inventories in Ansible allow you to source your inventory data from external systems dynamically. This can be from cloud providers, databases, or any system that can output JSON formatted to Ansibleâ€™s specifications.

**Why Use Dynamic Inventories?**
  - Scalability: Automatically adapts to changes in your infrastructure.
  - Accuracy: Ensures that your playbooks use the most current server information.
  - Flexibility: Easily integrates with cloud providers and other dynamic systems.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Before running this lab, ensure you have the following:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Install Ansible**: 2.9 or higher
  ```
  sudo apt install ansible -y
  ```
- **Install AWS CLI**
  ```
  sudo snap install aws-cli --classic
  ```
- **Install boto3**
  ```
  sudo apt install python3-boto3
  ```
- **Use Ansible Galaxy role to install Apache **
  ```
  ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
  ```
- **Target Server**: Remote or local machine with Ubuntu 24.04 installed
- **Access Keys**: Save access and secret access keys to be used to connect to aws account 
- **Access**: SSH access to the target server with sudo privileges
  
2. Ensure the following files are present:
   - `inventory`: make sure the inventory has the public DNS of the instance
   - `ansible.cfg`: put the paths for the inventory file, keypair file, and roles directory
   - `jenkins-main`: file to install Jenkins on target machine
     *copy contents of this file to roles/jenkins/tasks/main.yaml*
   - `docker-main`: file to install Docker on target machine
     *copy contents of this file to roles/docker/tasks/main.yaml*
   - `oc-main`: file to install OpenShift CLI on target machine
     *copy contents of this file to roles/oc/tasks/main.yaml*
   - `playbook10.yaml`


## **Steps:**

#### 1. Create roles directory
  ```
  mkdir roles
  cd roles
  ```
#### 2. Create roles using `ansible-galaxy`
  ```
 ansible-galaxy init jenkins
 ansible-galaxy init docker
 ansible-galaxy init oc
  ```
#### 3. Run the `tree` commmand to see the structure of the roles 
  ```
  tree
  ```
#### 4. Run the playbook
  ```
  ansible-playbook playbook10
  ```
